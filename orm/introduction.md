# Introduction

#### A drop-in Doctrine ORM 2 implementation for Laravel 6+

Doctrine 2 is an object-relational mapper (ORM) for PHP that provides transparent persistence for PHP objects. 
It uses the Data Mapper pattern at the heart, aiming for a complete separation of 
your domain/business logic from the persistence in a relational database management system.

The benefit of Doctrine for the programmer is the ability to focus on the object-oriented business 
logic and worry about persistence only as a secondary problem. This doesnâ€™t mean persistence is downplayed by Doctrine 2, 
however it is our belief that there are considerable benefits for object-oriented programming if persistence and entities are kept separated.
